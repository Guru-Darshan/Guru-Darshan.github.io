"Embarking on a dynamic dashboard project, I meticulously curated a comprehensive overview of the NBA team, Los Angeles Lakers, throughout the 2021-2022 season. This interactive dashboard not only features individual player statistics but also presents team performance metrics against various opponents over the entire season. Leveraging data extracted from Basketball Reference, I integrated box score data and advanced statistics, offering an in-depth analysis of player and team dynamics.

Dynamic referencing techniques were employed to create detailed player profiles, showcasing their performance in the regular season compared to the playoffs, all while aligning with team standards. The dashboard, constructed using slicers and pivot tables, provides a holistic view of the team's performance against every NBA team during the 2021-2022 season. This project underscores my proficiency in data visualization and analytics, offering a compelling narrative of the Lakers' journey throughout the season"

"In my latest project, I delved into the intricate world of Airbnb rentals in the vibrant city of London. Leveraging Python, I executed a meticulous analysis, including the strategic splitting of data columns to extract additional insights. String cleaning operations played a pivotal role in preparing the data for scrutiny. Rigorous filtering was employed to eliminate invalid rows and duplicate values, ensuring the dataset's integrity.

The data underwent a systematic reorganization, setting the stage for the next phase of analysis using Tableau. This project exemplifies my proficiency in data preprocessing and cleaning, paving the way for insightful visualizations and a deeper understanding of the Airbnb rental landscape in London.

As a seamless extension of the previous project, I crafted a dynamic Tableau dashboard dedicated to visualizing London's Airbnb properties. The dashboard incorporates an intuitive map feature, enabling users to selectively explore properties based on their respective neighborhoods. Employing calculated fields, I strategically grouped data elements, enhancing usability and fostering clearer visualizations.

A meticulously designed map provides a detailed overview of property density across London, coupled with insights into pricing variations. This informative display eliminates the need for extra clicks, offering a user-friendly experience. The dashboard includes a curated list of properties within each neighborhood, accompanied by a detailed tab revealing essential information such as size, room/bathroom count, and property ratings.

To enhance user accessibility, various filters were strategically implemented, ensuring a seamless experience while effortlessly accessing pertinent data. This project underscores my proficiency in Tableau, transforming complex datasets into interactive and visually compelling insights for a comprehensive exploration of London's Airbnb landscape."
