"Embarking on a dynamic dashboard project, I meticulously curated a comprehensive overview of the NBA team, Los Angeles Lakers, throughout the 2021-2022 season. This interactive dashboard not only features individual player statistics but also presents team performance metrics against various opponents over the entire season. Leveraging data extracted from Basketball Reference, I integrated box score data and advanced statistics, offering an in-depth analysis of player and team dynamics.

Dynamic referencing techniques were employed to create detailed player profiles, showcasing their performance in the regular season compared to the playoffs, all while aligning with team standards. The dashboard, constructed using slicers and pivot tables, provides a holistic view of the team's performance against every NBA team during the 2021-2022 season. This project underscores my proficiency in data visualization and analytics, offering a compelling narrative of the Lakers' journey throughout the season"

### [Python Analysis - Hotel_Booking_Analysis](https://github.com/Guru-Darshan/guru-darshan.github.io/blob/main/HotelBooking_Analysis.ipynb)
"I spearheaded a captivating data analysis project focused on hotel data, utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebooks to unravel meaningful insights. The project commenced with meticulous data cleaning, involving the identification and removal of duplicate rows, as well as filtering out invalid entries. Through manipulation techniques, the data was refined to extract pertinent insights, setting the stage for compelling visualizations.

The analysis incorporated statistical techniques to identify outliers within the dataset. Addressing diverse questions, such as booking trends by market segment and daily total guest arrivals, I employed a variety of visualizations tailored to convey only the essential information. This project showcased my proficiency in leveraging key Python packages, including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, to bring the data to life and derive valuable conclusions."
